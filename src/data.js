  text: `Hair type describes mainly hair patterns. As per the widely used Andre Walker System, there are four categories of hair types- based on curl patterns.
  `, text2: `Type 1 (Straight)- Type 1 hair has no natural curl pattern and lies flat on the scalp. Straight hair reflects the most shine as oil from the scalp can easily slip and slide down the lengths of hair strands to keep them moisturized. 
  `, text3: `Type 2 (Wavy) â€“ Type 2 tends to have definitive S-shaped multiple bends from roots to tips. Because of its shape, wavy hair is less oiler than Type 1. 
  `, text4: `Type 3 (Curly)- Type 3 hair is naturally curly and classified as spiral curls. As the follicles do not lay, flat, curly hair is prone to dryness. 
  `, text5: `Type 4 (Coiled/ Kinky) - Type 4 has tightly curled with defined ringlets. It may vary from a tightly coiled to a zigzag pattern (Z-shape). Because of follicle angles and kinks, scalp oils can't lubricate hair strands, making type 4 hair the most fragile, dry, and damage-prone.
  
  `, extra: `Note: It is natural and likely to have a mix of hair types on your head at once. But the most noticeable or prominent pattern is considered your hair type.

    "Fine- If you take a single hair in between your fingers, you can barely see, and you don't feel anything, then you have fine hair. Typically, fine hair has a diameter of about 50 microns.",

    "Medium- If you can feel the hair, then you have a medium width. Your hair is somewhere in-between (50-120 microns)",
  text4: "Thick/Coarse- If the hair strand looks thick and appears to be textured, the hair is coarse. Thick hair has a typical diameter of about 120 microns.",

It dries slowly, leaving products sticking around.`,

  text2: "Spray Bottle Test- Take a small section of your hair and mist it with 3-4 spritz from a spray bottle. Watch closely; if the water absorbs quickly, the hair is highly porous. If the water beads up on the hair, it has low porosity.",
  text3: "Water Cup Porosity Test- Simply drop a single clean non conditioned hair strand into a room temperature glass of water. After five to ten minutes, watch the strand to see if it sinks to the bottom (high porosity) or floats at the top (low porosity). If the hair strand falls slowly, then the hair has a medium porosity level.",
